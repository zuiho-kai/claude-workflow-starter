# PR Body Provenance

Use this before putting performance, accuracy, metric tables, or output images into a PR body or PR comment.

## Evidence matrix

Write this in the draft before publishing any performance / accuracy / image conclusion:

```markdown
| ID | Purpose | Input Source | Path | Requests | Batch Knobs | Timing Scope | Result | PR Placement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Compatibility smoke | Temporary prompt | DiT-only | 2 | max_num_seqs=2, diffusion_batch_size=2 | N/A | logs only | Test Result / smoke |
| E2 | Official accuracy | Official fixture | AR-to-DiT | 2 | DiT max_num_seqs=2, diffusion_batch_size=2 | N/A | CLIP/SSIM/PSNR + image | Test Result / accuracy |
| E3 | Official performance | Official fixture | AR-to-DiT | 2 | baseline 1/1 vs grouped 2/2 | omni.generate only | elapsed / throughput | Test Result / performance |
```

No matrix means no performance / accuracy / image claim.

## Required provenance

For every table or image, state:

- exact script or command;
- input and prompt;
- official/user-specified input vs smoke prompt;
- request count and batching knobs;
- timing scope and whether model initialization is excluded;
- metric reference;
- conclusion this evidence supports, and no more.

`Test Plan` describes how E1/E2/E3 can be reproduced. `Test Result` gives actual logs, metrics, tables, and stable image URLs. `Purpose` can only claim what the matrix supports.

Smoke evidence must be labeled `smoke` or `compatibility`; it cannot be titled `accuracy` or `performance`.

## Head binding

Before posting any test image, metric, or raw artifact URL:

```powershell
gh pr view <PR> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni --json headRefOid,headRefName,headRepositoryOwner
```

Then confirm run logs/status bind to the same checkout:

```bash
cat <status-file>      # must include WT=<sha> or HEAD=<sha>
grep -E 'HEAD=|WT=|1 passed|EXIT_STATUS|\[ONLINE\]' <log-file>
```

`headRefOid`, run `WT/HEAD`, metrics, and image mtime must belong to the same run. If not, do not post it as current evidence. Historical evidence must be labeled with its historical head.

## Image gate

Before posting:

```powershell
python -c "from PIL import Image; import sys; im=Image.open(sys.argv[1]); print(im.format, im.size, im.mode)" <image>
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 <image>
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri <raw-url> -Method Head -UseBasicParsing
```

Also open the image and confirm it is not blank, stale, broken, or the wrong case.

Use stable renderable URLs. Prefer an artifact branch with `raw.githubusercontent.com/.../artifact.png`. Do not open an artifact branch PR.

## What caused this

PR #3766 mixed DiT-only temporary smoke data with official IT2I / AR-to-DiT evidence. PR #3626 posted an online accuracy image from an older run and leaked an internal remote artifact path. The durable rule is: evidence is not publishable until it is bound to input, path, config, run head, and conclusion scope.
