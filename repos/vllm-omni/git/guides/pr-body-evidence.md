# PR Workflow · PR body entry

This page is the short entry for PR body writing. Deeper evidence rules live in:

- [pr_body_provenance](pr-body-provenance.md): performance / accuracy / image evidence, PR head binding, artifact provenance.
- [pr_body_model_evidence](pr-body-model-evidence.md): new model evidence split: source parity / stub smoke / real checkpoint.
- [pr_body_privacy](pr-body-privacy.md): public PR body privacy and remote/local environment redaction.

## Template

Before writing or editing a vLLM-Omni PR description, read `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

vLLM-Omni PR bodies use exactly:

```markdown
## Purpose
## Test Plan
## Test Result
```

Rules:

- Keep these headings unchanged.
- `Test Plan` is for commands / scripts / reproduction path.
- `Test Result` is for actual validation result, metric, image, or pass/fail summary.
- Do not use generic `Summary / Testing`.
- Do not mechanically list `DCO`, CI job names, old validation SHAs, or machine bookkeeping unless the user explicitly asks for provenance or the PR evidence needs it.

Small bugfix / reviewer-followup PRs should read like reviewer-facing behavior notes: what was broken, what changed, how it was covered.

## Render gate

Trigger when opening a PR, editing a PR body, or posting PR evidence / images.

Do not:

- dump work-log checklists into `Test Plan`;
- use temporary image hosts such as `tmpfiles`, `0x0`, or `transfer.sh`;
- write Markdown code fences inside PowerShell double-quoted here-strings.

Use no-BOM UTF-8 body files:

````powershell
$body = @'
## Purpose

...

```bash
command
```
'@
$tmp = [System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName()
$utf8NoBom = New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding($false)
[System.IO.File]::WriteAllText($tmp, $body, $utf8NoBom)
gh pr edit <PR> --body-file $tmp
Remove-Item $tmp
````

Read back after update:

```powershell
$view = gh pr view <PR> --repo vllm-project/vllm-omni --json body,url,isDraft | ConvertFrom-Json
$view.body.Contains('```bash')
$view.body.Contains('```yaml')
$view.body.Contains('```python')
$view.body -match "[\x00-\x08\x0B\x0C\x0E-\x1F]"  # must be False
```

## Public reproduction

For e2e / accuracy / performance PR bodies, `Test Plan` should be copyable by a reviewer and contain only public or repo-relative information:

- repo-relative script path or command;
- repo-relative YAML path and key fields;
- prompt, image, sampling params, or `Omni.generate` request construction;
- metric calculation and public reference file / artifact;
- stable artifact URL when needed.

Machine, cwd, venv, env vars, internal host/path/cache details belong in a private validation artifact, not the public PR body. See [pr_body_privacy](pr-body-privacy.md).

## Evidence downshift

If the PR uses performance, accuracy, or image evidence, read [pr_body_provenance](pr-body-provenance.md) before writing the body.

If the PR is a new model / pipeline / backend / checkpoint adapter, read [pr_body_model_evidence](pr-body-model-evidence.md) before writing the body.

## Suggested shape

```markdown
## Purpose

<behavior problem and smallest fix boundary>

## Test Plan

### Public Reproduction
### Run Command
### Request Construction
### Metric Comparison

## Test Result

### E2E Evidence
### Metrics
### Artifacts
```

Acceptance: the PR page reads like a reproducible reviewer report, not a chat log.
