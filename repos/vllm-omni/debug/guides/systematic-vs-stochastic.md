When user reports "path A consistently produces X, path B consistently produces Y" on the same model with the same seed:

## Rule 1: Systematic ≠ stochastic. Classify first.

| Signal | Class | First-line investigation |
|---|---|---|
| "X every time on A, Y every time on B" (cross-path bias) | **Systematic** | Diff inputs to the model byte-by-byte. The two paths must be feeding different inputs. |
| "X then Y then Z on same path same seed" (within-path drift) | **Stochastic** | CUDA non-determinism / MoE BF16 / scheduler timing. Different fix class (deterministic mode, etc.). |
| Both | Both | Treat as systematic FIRST. Stochastic on top is a separate concern. |

**Why:** "CUDA / MoE non-determinism" is a tempting last-resort explanation for cross-path bias because (a) it's a known real thing for some models including HunyuanImage-3.0 (see CLAUDE.md B19), and (b) it sounds technical. But it explains **noise within a path**, not **systematic bias between paths**. If you invoke it for cross-path bias you're projecting a known phenomenon onto an unrelated bug.

## Rule 2: Model input is 3 pillars, not 1.

For an autoregressive multimodal model (HunyuanImage-3.0 AR), the model receives:

1. **Text token IDs** (`prompt_token_ids` or BPE-encoded `prompt` string)
2. **Multimodal data** (PIL images → preprocessor → tensors)
3. **Sampling params** (seed, temperature, top_k, max_tokens, stop_tokens, ...)

Aligning pillar 1 byte-for-byte across paths (which I did via P0 prompt_token_ids fix) does **NOT** mean the model sees identical input. Pillar 2 and 3 must also be byte-equivalent. In the RGBA case I missed, pillar 1 was byte-identical between online and offline but pillar 2 differed (RGBA composited over white online vs over black offline) → AR saw two different image tensors → different cot → different output.

**How to apply:**

```
For each AR input pillar, dump from both paths and diff:
  - prompt_token_ids   (or prompt string, post-tokenize)
  - multi_modal_data["image"] -> processor -> tensor (compare image_tensor.numpy() byte-wise)
  - sampling_params (compare repr())
```

If pillar 1 matches but pillar 2 diverges, the upstream-of-model preprocessing is the bug.

## Rule 3: PIL Image mode is a silent bug source.

`Image.open(rgba_png)` returns mode RGBA. Different downstream consumers handle the alpha channel differently:

- `.convert("RGB")` composites transparent pixels over **black** (the offline path uses this)
- Some processors composite over **white** (Hunyuan AR's vae_processor does this)
- Some processors pass RGBA through and the model sees 4-channel input

A logo PNG with 57k transparent pixels can produce two completely different RGB tensors depending on which alpha-compositing convention the path uses. This is enough to make AR recaption diverge ("1 magnet on black bg" vs "3 magnets on white bg"), which is the exact failure mode of PR #3444 online vs offline.

**How to apply:** When two paths consume `multi_modal_data["image"]`, check the PIL mode of the input AND look at how each processor handles alpha. If you spot `.convert("RGB")` on one side and an alpha-composite on the other, that's the bug.

## Rule 4: Don't accept "good enough" when user says "still wrong".

If you apply a fix and the symptom partially improves but doesn't fully go away, **keep digging**. Don't escalate to "this is inherent" until you've enumerated every layer.

My specific failure mode: I had P0 (prompt_token_ids) + P1 (task/bot_task/sys_type split) + KV-reuse fix. Each was a real improvement, but the "online consistently 3 magnets" complaint persisted. Instead of asking "what AR input dimension am I still missing?", I jumped to "this is CUDA non-determinism, inherent, can't fix." Codex on the same problem refused to stop until he found the image-channel divergence. The difference is methodology, not raw skill.

**How to apply:**
- After each fix, restate the symptom in the user's words and ask "does this fix explain the symptom?"
- If the answer is "partial" or "I'm not sure", treat it as "no" and keep enumerating.
- "CUDA non-determinism" / "inherent characteristic" is the LAST hypothesis to accept, not the first.

## Rule 5: When the user gives a symptom that uses the word "一直/consistently/always", the answer is NOT stochastic.

User said: "**online 能一直复现**，offline 没出现过 3 个". I treated this as "with noise, both paths land in different neighborhoods". Wrong. "一直复现" is a strong signal of **deterministic systematic** divergence. The right reaction is: "what's the same in every online run that's not in any offline run? something on the path must always trigger differently."

## Specific PR #3444 lesson (2026-05-12)

- I spent ~hours auditing seed propagation, cond VAE generator handling, deterministic mode tradeoffs.
- Codex spent ~time on the same problem, ran image diffs alongside prompt diffs, found `input_1_0.png` is RGBA with 57671 transparent pixels, fixed `_load_input_images` to normalize-RGB when Hunyuan-aware API is used.
- Codex's fix is a single ~10-line patch with conservative gating. Mine (cond VAE) is orthogonal and only addresses within-path drift, not the cross-path bias.
- Memory cost vs root-cause finding: I had `painterly_silent_bugs.md` flagging similar `.sample()`-without-generator class, but I missed the much simpler upstream "PIL mode" silent bug. **Old memories can bias toward known-similar-but-not-actually-this bugs.**
